# Gleam Advent of Code

I'm learning [Gleam](https://gleam.run) by doing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) [2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

## Development

```sh
gleam run   # Run the project
```
Requires an `inputs/dayN.txt` for every `dayN.gleam` that exists.

## Testing

```sh
gleam test  # Test the project
```
Requires an `inputs/dayN.txt` and an `outputs/dayN.txt` (as many lines as parts) for every `dayN_test.gleam` that exists.

Alternatively, use `gleam test _demo` to run tests on the `inputs_demo` and `outputs_demo` directories instead.
